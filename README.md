# Assembling and playing the game

This project was made using NESASM 3 by bunnyboy, so you'll need it installed in your machine if you want to assembly it yourself.

The `run.sh` script must be run in the project root folder (as it will try to `cd game`).

If you have `nesasm` and `mednafen` commands in your machine but the script keeps complaining, just run it with the `--nochecks` flag as shown below.

```
./run.sh --nocheck
```
