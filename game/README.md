# Assembling and playing the game

This project was made using NESASM 3 by bunnyboy, so it needs to be installed in your machine if you want to assembly it yourself.

The `run.sh` script must be run in the `game` folder.

If you have `nesasm` and `mednafen` commands in your machine but the script keeps complaining, just run it with the `--nochecks` flag as shown below.

```
./run.sh --nochecks
```

The script can also assemble the game before running it by using the `--assemble` flag.
